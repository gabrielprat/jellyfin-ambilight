        "changelog": "# Release Notes - v1.5.7\n\n## 🎯 Device Mapping Matching Fix\n\n- Device mappings created from the settings UI now store the human-readable device name instead of Jellyfin's internal device ID.\n- Playback matching uses the current session's DeviceName, so mappings remain stable even if Jellyfin changes internal device IDs.\n- Existing mappings that were created with internal IDs will still load in the UI, but you may want to re-select the device in the dropdown and save to migrate them to the new, name-based identifiers.\n\n## 📦 Installation & Upgrade\n\n- For installation and upgrade instructions, see the `INSTALLATION.md` file in the repository.\n- After upgrading:\n  1. Restart Jellyfin.\n  2. Open the Ambilight plugin settings, review your Device Mappings, and re-save them if needed so they use device names.\n\n",
