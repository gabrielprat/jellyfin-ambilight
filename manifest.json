Restart Jellyfin.\n  2. Open the Ambilight plugin settings, review your **Device Mappings**, and re-save them if needed so they use device names.\n\n",

Restart Jellyfin once to load the new plugin version.\n  2. Configure or adjust your device mappings; further changes should no longer require additional restarts.\n\n",
