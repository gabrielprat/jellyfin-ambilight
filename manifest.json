FFmpeg couldn't automatically convert between these incompatible formats.\n\n**Solution:** Modified the FFmpeg filter chain to explicitly transfer frames from GPU to CPU memory before applying software filters:\n\n```bash\n# Before (broken):\n-hwaccel qsv -i \"video.mkv\" -vf scale=320:180 ...\n\n# After (fixed):\n-hwaccel qsv -i \"video.mkv\" -vf hwdownload,format=nv12,scale=320:180 ...\n```\n\nThe `hwdownload,format=nv12` pipeline:\n1. Downloads frames from GPU to CPU memory\n2. Converts to NV12 pixel format (software-compatible)\n3. Allows the scale filter to work correctly\n\n**Impact:**\n- ✅ Intel Quick Sync (QSV) now works reliably on Intel CPUs (N100, etc.)\n- ✅ CUDA acceleration fixed for NVIDIA GPUs\n- ✅ VideoToolbox acceleration fixed for macOS systems\n- ✅ VAAPI continues to work as before\n- ℹ️ \"Auto\" mode remains unchanged (CPU-only decoding)\n\n**Tested On:**\n- Intel N100 with Linux + QSV\n- Jellyfin transcoding environment\n\n## 📄 Licensing\n\n### Added GPLv3 License\n\nThe project is now officially licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0**:\n\n- ✅ Added complete LICENSE file with GPLv3 text\n- ✅ Added SPDX license headers to all source files\n- ✅ Updated project metadata in `.csproj` file\n- ✅ Documented license terms and freedoms in README\n- ✅ Added copyright attribution to \"Jellyfin Ambilight Contributors\"\n\n**What this means:**\n- You're free to use, modify, and distribute this software\n- Any distributed modifications must also be licensed under GPLv3\n- Source code must remain available\n\nFor details, see the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file or visit https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html\n\n## 🔧 Project Improvements\n\n### Reorganized Release Notes\n\n- Created dedicated `release-notes/` folder for all version release notes\n- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to read from new location\n- Improved workflow robustness when release notes are missing\n- Release notes now automatically included in GitHub releases\n\n## 📝 Migration Notes\n\n### For Users\n\n**No action required** - simply update to v1.5.0:\n\n1. Download the latest plugin from the releases page\n2. Replace `Jellyfin.Plugin.Ambilight.dll` in your plugins folder\n3. Restart Jellyfin\n\nIf you were previously unable to use QSV/CUDA/VideoToolbox acceleration, you can now enable it in the plugin settings.\n\n### For Developers\n\nIf you're forking or contributing to this project, please note:\n- The project is now GPLv3-licensed\n- All source files include SPDX license headers\n- Any contributions must be compatible with GPLv3\n\n## 🔗 Links\n\n- **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/gabrielprat/jellyfin-ambilight/compare/v1.4.2...v1.5.0\n- **License**: [LICENSE](../LICENSE)\n- **Installation Guide**: [README.md](../README.md#installation)\n\n---\n\n**Upgrade Today!** 🚀\n",
