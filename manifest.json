        "changelog": "# Release Notes - v1.5.5\n\n## 🔄 Hardware Acceleration Fix - Reverted to v1.4.2 Approach\n\nThis release fixes the hardware acceleration issues that were introduced in v1.5.0 and persisted through v1.5.4 by reverting to the proven v1.4.2 implementation.\n\n## 🐛 Problem Summary\n\nVersions v1.5.0 through v1.5.4 attempted to fix hardware acceleration but introduced breaking changes:\n\n### What Went Wrong\n\n**v1.5.0-v1.5.4 Errors:**\n\nWith **QSV** (Intel Quick Sync):\n```\n[hwdownload @ 0x...] Invalid output format nv12 for hwframe download.\n[hwdownload @ 0x...] Invalid output format yuv420p for hwframe download.\nFailed to configure output pad on Parsed_hwdownload_0\n```\n\nWith **VAAPI**:\n```\nImpossible to convert between the formats supported by the filter\nError reinitializing filters!\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe v1.5.0-v1.5.4 releases tried to explicitly manage frame transfers from GPU to CPU using FFmpeg's `hwdownload` filter with various format specifications. This approach didn't work correctly with FFmpeg in Jellyfin's environment.\n\n**v1.4.2 (working)** used a simpler approach: enable hardware acceleration for decoding only and let FFmpeg automatically handle any necessary format conversions.\n\n## ✅ Solution - Reverted to v1.4.2\n\nThis release reverts the hardware acceleration implementation to match v1.4.2 exactly:\n\n```bash\n# v1.5.0-v1.5.4 (broken):\n-hwaccel vaapi -i \"video.mkv\" -vf hwdownload,format=...,scale=320:180 ...\n\n# v1.4.2 & v1.5.5 (working):\n-hwaccel vaapi -i \"video.mkv\" -vf scale=320:180 ...\n```\n\n### What Changed\n\n**Code Changes:**\n- Removed all `hwdownload` filter logic\n- Removed explicit format specifications (`format=nv12`, `format=yuv420p`)\n- Restored simple filter chain: just `scale=` for resizing\n- Hardware acceleration is used **only for video decoding**\n- FFmpeg automatically transfers frames to CPU memory as needed\n\n**Result:**\n- ✅ VAAPI working correctly (tested on Intel N100)\n- ✅ Intel Quick Sync (QSV) should work as it did in v1.4.2\n- ✅ CUDA acceleration should work\n- ✅ VideoToolbox acceleration should work\n- ✅ \"Auto\" mode unchanged (CPU-only decoding)\n\n## 📊 Version History\n\n| Version | Approach | Status |\n|---------|----------|--------|\n| v1.4.2 | Simple hardware decoding | ✅ Working |\n| v1.5.0 | Added `hwdownload,format=nv12` | ❌ Failed |\n| v1.5.1 | Changed to `format=yuv420p` | ❌ Failed |\n| v1.5.3 | Workflow fixes only | ❌ Still broken |\n| v1.5.4 | Removed format, kept hwdownload | ❌ Still failed |\n| **v1.5.5** | **Reverted to v1.4.2 approach** | **✅ Working** |\n\n## 📝 What's Included\n\nThis release includes:\n- ✅ Hardware acceleration fix (reverted to v1.4.2)\n- ✅ GPLv3 licensing (from v1.5.0)\n- ✅ Workflow fixes for manifest.json (from v1.5.3)\n- ✅ All features from v1.4.0+ (scheduled tasks, extraction priority, etc.)\n\n## 🔧 Migration Notes\n\n### For Users\n\n**Highly Recommended Upgrade** if you want to use hardware acceleration:\n\n1. Download v1.5.5 from the releases page\n2. Replace `Jellyfin.Plugin.Ambilight.dll` in your plugins folder: `/config/plugins/Ambilight/`\n3. Restart Jellyfin\n4. Enable hardware acceleration in plugin settings (VAAPI, QSV, CUDA, or VideoToolbox)\n5. Run extractions - they should now work with hardware acceleration\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter upgrading to v1.5.5:\n- Hardware-accelerated extraction should complete successfully\n- No more \"Invalid output format\" or \"Impossible to convert\" errors\n- Extraction speed should be significantly faster with hardware acceleration\n- Works exactly as v1.4.2 did with hardware acceleration\n\n### If You're on v1.4.2\n\nYou can safely upgrade to v1.5.5 to get:\n- GPLv3 licensing\n- Improved GitHub workflow\n- All the features from v1.4.0-v1.4.2\n- Same reliable hardware acceleration you already have\n\n## 🙏 Apologies\n\nWe apologize for the issues with hardware acceleration in v1.5.0-v1.5.4. The attempt to improve hardware acceleration handling actually broke it. This release restores the proven, working implementation from v1.4.2.\n\n## 🔗 Links\n\n- **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/gabrielprat/jellyfin-ambilight/compare/v1.4.2...v1.5.5\n- **Previous Working Release**: [v1.4.2](https://github.com/gabrielprat/jellyfin-ambilight/releases/tag/v1.4.2)\n- **Installation Guide**: [README.md](../README.md#installation)\n\n---\n\n**Hardware acceleration restored to working state!** 🎉✅\n",
