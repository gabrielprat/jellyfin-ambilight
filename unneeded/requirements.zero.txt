# ZERO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES!
# Everything we need is in Python standard library:
# - requests → can be replaced with urllib (in stdlib)
# - numpy → replace with pure Python + struct module
# - All other dependencies → REMOVED!

# For now, keep requests for simplicity, but it could be removed too
requests==2.31.0
